        I go around the internet by name HeX The Cat, born 1994, peddling in Technomancy™ (as per my grandparents).
        In case you're possible future employer, then you should also know me by actual name as I've linked this page to you.
        If you've just stumbled upon this page by random chance.. welcome I guess?<br/><br/>

        I studied Business Information Technology in Satakunta University of Applied Sciences, focusing in software development.
        Currently my main skill are in Svelte & React, and mostly in web page development.<br/><br/>
        
        Majority of my free time is spent by computer, mainly playing games, sometimes coding, occasionally digital drawing.
        Games I mostly play can be found in Games tab along with few videos.
        Video editing is another thing I occasionally do, these days mainly doing small compilations of the games I play with friends, altho most of them are hidden.<br/><br/>

        I'm avid enjoyer of Anime, which I've been watching since Pokémon first aired in finnish TV in 1999.
        Sure, I didn't really back then distinguish it from any other saturday morning shows as genre, but some years later it became prominent part of media I consumed.
        These days I have 1-3 shows every season I follow actively as new episode comes out each week.<br/><br/>

        I also herd a group of weebs in a guild called Arboretum Harbour in game called Azur Lane as their guild master.
        Originally hijacked guild from old leader gone inactive, reformed little before Guild 2.0 update in late 2020.
        "Job" mainly consists of upholding law in discord server, helping players and keeping few in-game guild missions running.
        Guild itself consists of about 50 active players, from which about 10 are also actively chatting in guild discord about the game and non-game related stuff.
        Smol Bluebirb, discord bot made by me using Javascript, also lives in the server as a dedicated notification chirper, and is the goodest little discord bot there is.
