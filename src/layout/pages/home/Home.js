                Made tool for quick searching basic Pokémon info using <u><a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className=" links">PokéAPI</a></u>.<br/>
                Mainly tooled for phone usage while playing Pokémon myself, but have gotten very good feedback from friends trying it out as well.<br/>
                Find it&nbsp;<u><a href="https://hex-the-cat.github.io/pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className=" links">here</a></u>.

                Also created website for&nbsp;<u><a href="https://brokencodegames.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className=" links">Broken Code Games</a></u> as a part of uni's work trainee period.<br/>
                They wanted older looking web page so that's what I tried my best to do.<br/>
                The development of the game has sadly come to an end without release.
                <br/><br/>
                Plans for rewriting the webpage into more presentable condition.. underway..
